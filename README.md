# What Is Design Pattern #
Design patterns are conventional responses to typical issues that arise in software design. To fix a reoccurring design issue in your code, you can modify them like pre-made blueprints.
## Why do I need to Learn Patterns? ##
In actuality, you could be able to function as a programmer for many years without being aware of any patterns. Many people act in that manner. However, even in that scenario, you can unknowingly be using some patterns. Why then would you bother knowing them?
- A toolset of tried-and-true solutions to typical issues in software design is known as design patterns. Knowing patterns is helpful even if you never run into these issues since it teaches you how to approach any issue using object-oriented design principles.
With the help of design patterns, you and your team members can communicate more effectively. You can simply propose. 
## Pattern Classification ##
Architectural patterns are the most widespread and high-level patterns. Developers can use almost any language to implement these patterns. They can be used to create the architecture of a whole application, unlike other patterns.
All patterns can also be grouped according to their intent or goal. Three basic categories of pattern are covered in this book:
-  Creational patterns , offer methods for creating objects that improve flexibility and allow current code to be reused.
- Structural patterns ,describe how to put together smaller structures out of objects and classes while making these structures adaptable and effective.
- Behavioral patterns ,manage efficient interaction and the delegation of duties amongst objects.
