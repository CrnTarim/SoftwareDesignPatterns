# Singleton Design Pattern Example

This repository provides an example implementation of the Singleton design pattern in C#. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global access point to that instance.


## Overview

The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. It is useful in scenarios where having multiple instances of a class can lead to problems such as resource contention or inconsistent state.

### Advantages

- **Resource optimization**: The Singleton pattern optimizes resource usage by ensuring that only one instance of the class is created.
- **Lazy initialization**: The instance is created when it is first accessed, delaying its creation until it is actually needed.
- **Global accessibility**: The single instance is globally accessible, providing a convenient way to access it throughout the application.
- **Controlled access**: The Singleton pattern allows for controlled access to the instance, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations.

### Disadvantages

- **Testing difficulties**: The global state introduced by the Singleton pattern can make unit testing more challenging.
- **Reduced parallelism**: The use of synchronization mechanisms in Singleton implementations may limit parallel processing.
- **Potential memory leakage**: The persistence of the Singleton object throughout its lifecycle may increase the risk of memory leaks.
- **Dependency storage**: Storing dependencies within a Singleton instance can be more complex due to the limited access points.



```csharp
// Create a new instance of the Singleton
Singleton singleton = Singleton.Instance;

// Use the Singleton instance
singleton.DoSomething();
