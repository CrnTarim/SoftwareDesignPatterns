## Factory Method Design Pattern

The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an alternative method for creating related objects. It abstracts the object creation process using an interface or abstract class. The object creation is performed by a method called the Factory Method, which determines the class of the object to be created and returns the corresponding object. Users can obtain objects using the Factory Method without having to know the specific class. This allows for the creation of objects of different types and decouples the object usage from their concrete implementations.

### Benefits of Using the Factory Method Design Pattern:

- Provides an alternative way of creating related objects.
- Abstracts the object creation process using an interface or abstract class.
- Allows for the creation of objects of different types based on the same interface or abstract class.
- Decouples the usage of objects from their concrete implementations.
- Promotes flexibility and maintainability in the codebase.
